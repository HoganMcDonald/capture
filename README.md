## Planning

I want to begin by considering the user experience for the app. Below are the major components of the user experience that smaller tasks will fit within.

1. Authentication
2. capture main landing page
3. buckets view
4. categorizing snippets
5. editing content
6. search bar
7. analyzing tone
8. exporting bucket
9. deleting snippets and Buckets

Now, each item listed above can be broken down into smaller tasks for development.

### 1. Authentication

[] Login landing page
[] Registration form
[] client post request
[] server post route at '/'
[] bcrypt
[] mongo query
[]

### 2. Capture main landing page

[] text input link
[] photo file upload
[] post request - client
[] server post route
[]
